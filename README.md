<h1> Description </h1>
<h2> Data Input</h2>
<p> The closing prices of 30 different stocks over 80 weeks</p>

<h2> Project Objective </h2>
<p> I calculated the optimal portfolio asset allocation using Gaussian Mixture Models and applying the Markowitz theory using R code. I also provided an interactive visualization to gain better understanding in the asset prices' trends.
  The final quality of the analysis is based on the portfolio returns using this method versus the portfolio returns using equal allocation. </p>

<h2> Data Output </h2>
<p> A vector showcasing the allocation of each asset</p>
